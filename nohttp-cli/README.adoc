This is a utility for finding and replacing http URLs.
It takes into account whitelisting rules that nohttp uses.

= Usage

The application uses Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html[Application Plugin].
This summarizes the behavior, but for additional details read about the plugin in the link above.

== Installing

To use it first install the app

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :nohttp-cli:installDist
----

The shell script is now available at `nohttp-cli/build/install/nohttp-cli/bin/nohttp-cli`.
Our guide will only type in `nohttp-cli` but you should type in the absolute path.

== Running

It is best to run this in a folder that does not have any files with build output.
If you use git, a great way to ensure that there are no build output is to do a fresh clone.
Alternatively, you can remove all files not added to git using `git clean -dfx`.
Keep in mind this may delete things you want (i.e. IDE related files).

=== Current Working Directory

The easiest approach is to run the application with no arguments.
This will attempt to find all text based files in the current directory.
The process for checking if it is a text file uses a native invocation of `grep`.
If you cannot run `grep`, then you should try Specifying Paths option below.

You can try to process all text based files in the current directory by running the script with no arguments.

[source,bash]
----
<path>/nohttp-cli
----

=== Specifying Paths

You can also specify one or more paths as arguments that you want to process explicitly.
This allows you to customize what is processed.
Any directory will be traversed and all files in the directory will be processed.
You can specify absolute paths or paths that are relative to the current working directory.
If you need finer grain control you can specify individual files.

This sample shows how to process the `build.gradle` file and all the files within `src/main/java`.

[source,bash]
----
<path>/nohttp-cli build.gradle src/main/java/
----
